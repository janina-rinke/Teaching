# Genome assembly: kmer counting and assembly

Today we are going to count DNA kmers, (i) assemble a portion of a genome and (ii) run a pipeline to assemble and annotate a mitochondrial genome. This is really exciting. 

### 1.1 Create a directory. 
In order to keep your project neat, go to your home folder and make a folder for your work today such as:

```
mkdir genome_assembly
```
