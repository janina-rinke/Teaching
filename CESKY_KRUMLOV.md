# Genome assembly: kmer counting and assembly

Today we are going to count DNA kmers, (i) assemble a portion of a genome and (ii) run a pipeline to assemble and annotate a mitochondrial genome. This is really exciting. 

## 1. Count kmers
### 1.1. Create a directory
In order to keep your project neat, go to your home folder and make a folder for your work today such as:
```
mkdir genome_assembly
mkdir genome_assembly_kmers
mkdir genome_assembly_hifiasm
mkdir genome_assembly_MitoHiFi
```
### 1.2 Sym link files
